# Descriptive-Statistic-of-Commodities-Price-in-Box-Plot
I try to visualize adjustment price of Commodities which contains Gold, Silver, Platinum, Crude Oil, and Copper. Using Python libraries, such as : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, box plot could be created and with inherent descritive statistics.

1. First of all, download daily historical data from yahoo finance from each Commodities stock for 5 years, from 25 April 2016-23 April 2021. And sort the data into 1 file excel.
